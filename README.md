.NET module/assembly reader/writer library written for [de4dot](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot/).


dnlib was created because de4dot needed a robust .NET assembly library that
could handle all types of obfuscated assemblies. de4dot used to use Mono.Cecil
but since Mono.Cecil can't handle obfuscated assemblies, doesn't fully support
mixed mode assemblies, doesn't read .NET assemblies the same way the [CLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) does
and many other missing features de4dot needed, dnlib was a necessity. The API
is similar because it made porting de4dot to dnlib a lot easier.

For another application using dnlib, see [ConfuserEx](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx/)
(a .NET obfuscator). It uses many of the more advanced features of dnlib. Have
a look at its writer code which gets executed during the assembly writing
process.

Compiling
---------

You must have Visual Studio 2008 or later. The solution file was created by
Visual Studio 2010, so if you use VS2008, open the solution file and change the
version number so VS2008 can read it.

Examples
--------

All examples use C#, but since it's a .NET library, you can use any .NET
language (eg. VB.NET).

See the Examples project for several examples.

Opening a .NET assembly/module
------------------------------

First of all, the important namespaces are `dnlib.DotNet` and
`dnlib.DotNet.Emit`. `dnlib.DotNet.Emit` is only needed if you intend to
read/write method bodies. All the examples below assume you have the
appropriate using statements at the top of each source file:

```csharp
using dnlib.DotNet;
using dnlib.DotNet.Emit;
```

ModuleDefMD is the class that is created when you open a .NET module. It has
several `Load()` methods that will create a ModuleDefMD instance. If it's not a
.NET module/assembly, a `BadImageFormatException` will be thrown.

Read a .NET module from a file:

```csharp
ModuleDefMD module = ModuleDefMD.Load(@"C:\path\to\file.exe");
```

Read a .NET module from a byte array:

```csharp
byte[] data = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(@"C:\path\of\file.dll");
ModuleDefMD module = ModuleDefMD.Load(data);
```

You can also pass in a Stream instance, an address in memory (HINSTANCE) or
even a System.Reflection.Module instance:

```csharp
System.Reflection.Module reflectionModule = typeof(void).Module;	// Get mscorlib.dll's module
ModuleDefMD module = ModuleDefMD.Load(reflectionModule);
```

To get the assembly, use its Assembly property:

```csharp
AssemblyDef asm = module.Assembly;
Console.WriteLine("Assembly: {0}", asm);
```

Saving a .NET assembly/module
-----------------------------

Use `module.Write()`. It can save the assembly to a file or a Stream.

```csharp
module.Write(@"C:\saved-assembly.dll");
```

If it's a C++/CLI assembly, you should use `NativeWrite()`

```csharp
module.NativeWrite(@"C:\saved-assembly.dll");
```

To detect it at runtime, use this code:

```csharp
if (module.IsILOnly) {
	// This assembly has only IL code, and no native code (eg. it's a C# or VB assembly)
	module.Write(@"C:\saved-assembly.dll");
}
else {
	// This assembly has native code (eg. C++/CLI)
	module.NativeWrite(@"C:\saved-assembly.dll");
}
```

PDB files
---------

Right after opening the module, call one of its `LoadPdb()` methods. You can
also pass in a `ModuleCreationOptions` to `ModuleDefMD.Load()` and if one of
the PDB options is enabled, the PDB file will be opened before `Load()`
returns.

```csharp
var mod = ModuleDefMD.Load(@"C:\myfile.dll");
mod.LoadPdb();	// Will load C:\myfile.pdb if it exists
```

To save a PDB file, create a `ModuleWriterOptions` /
`NativeModuleWriterOptions` and set its `WritePdb` property to `true`. By
default, it will create a PDB file with the same name as the output assembly
but with a `.pdb` extension. You can override this by writing the PDB file
name to `PdbFileName` or writing your own stream to `PdbStream`. If
`PdbStream` is initialized, `PdbFileName` should also be initialized because
the name of the PDB file will be written to the PE file. Another more
advanced property is `CreatePdbSymbolWriter` which returns a `ISymbolWriter2`
instance that dnlib will use.

```csharp
var mod = ModuleDefMD.Load(@"C:\myfile.dll");

var wopts = new dnlib.DotNet.Writer.ModuleWriterOptions(mod);
wopts.WritePdb = true;
// wopts.PdbFileName = @"C:\out2.pdb";	// Set other file name
mod.Write(@"C:\out.dll", wopts);
```

The current PDB reader and writer code use diasymreader.dll to read and write
PDB files so it will only work if the OS is Windows.

Strong name sign an assembly
----------------------------

Use the following code to strong name sign the assembly when saving it:

```csharp
using dnlib.DotNet.Writer;

// Open or create an assembly
ModuleDef mod = ModuleDefMD.Load(.....);

// Create writer options
var opts = new ModuleWriterOptions(mod);

// Open or create the strong name key
var signatureKey = new StrongNameKey(@"c:\my\file.snk");

// This method will initialize the required properties
opts.InitializeStrongNameSigning(mod, signatureKey);

// Write and strong name sign the assembly
mod.Write(@"C:\out\file.dll", opts);
```

Enhanced strong name signing an assembly
----------------------------------------

See this [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh415055.aspx)
for info on enhanced strong naming.

Enhanced strong name signing without key migration:

```csharp
using dnlib.DotNet.Writer;

// Open or create an assembly
ModuleDef mod = ModuleDefMD.Load(....);

// Open or create the signature keys
var signatureKey = new StrongNameKey(....);
var signaturePubKey = new StrongNamePublicKey(....);

// Create module writer options
var opts = new ModuleWriterOptions(mod);

// This method will initialize the required properties
opts.InitializeEnhancedStrongNameSigning(mod, signatureKey, signaturePubKey);

// Write and strong name sign the assembly
mod.Write(@"C:\out\file.dll", opts);
```

Enhanced strong name signing with key migration:

```csharp
using dnlib.DotNet.Writer;

// Open or create an assembly
ModuleDef mod = ModuleDefMD.Load(....);

// Open or create the identity and signature keys
var signatureKey = new StrongNameKey(....);
var signaturePubKey = new StrongNamePublicKey(....);
var identityKey = new StrongNameKey(....);
var identityPubKey = new StrongNamePublicKey(....);

// Create module writer options
var opts = new ModuleWriterOptions(mod);

// This method will initialize the required properties and add
// the required attribute to the assembly.
opts.InitializeEnhancedStrongNameSigning(mod, signatureKey, signaturePubKey, identityKey, identityPubKey);

// Write and strong name sign the assembly
mod.Write(@"C:\out\file.dll", opts);
```

Type classes
------------

The metadata has three type tables: `TypeRef`, `TypeDef`, and `TypeSpec`. The
classes dnlib use are called the same. These three classes all implement
`ITypeDefOrRef`.

There's also type signature classes. The base class is `TypeSig`. You'll find
`TypeSig`s in method signatures (return type and parameter types) and locals.
The `TypeSpec` class also has a `TypeSig` property.

All of these types implement `IType`.

`TypeRef` is a reference to a type in (usually) another assembly.

`TypeDef` is a type definition and it's a type defined in some module. This
class does *not* derive from `TypeRef`. :)

`TypeSpec` can be a generic type, an array type, etc.

`TypeSig` is the base class of all type signatures (found in method sigs and
locals). It has a `Next` property that points to the next `TypeSig`. Eg. a
Byte[] would first contain a `SZArraySig`, and its `Next` property would point
to Byte signature.

`CorLibTypeSig` is a simple corlib type. You don't create these directly. Use
eg. `module.CorLibTypes.Int32` to get a System.Int32 type signature.

`ValueTypeSig` is used when the next class is a value type.

`ClassSig` is used when the next class is a reference type.

`GenericInstSig` is a generic instance type. It has a reference to the generic
type (a `TypeDef` or a `TypeRef`) and the generic arguments.

`PtrSig` is a pointer sig.

`ByRefSig` is a by reference type.

`ArraySig` is a multi-dimensional array type. Most likely when you create an
array, you should use `SZArraySig`, and *not* `ArraySig`.

`SZArraySig` is a single dimension, zero lower bound array. In C#, a `byte[]`
is a `SZArraySig`, and *not* an `ArraySig`.

`GenericVar` is a generic type variable.

`GenericMVar` is a generic method variable.

Some examples if you're not used to the way type signatures are represented
in metadata:

```csharp
ModuleDef mod = ....;

// Create a byte[]
SZArraySig array1 = new SZArraySig(mod.CorLibTypes.Byte);

// Create an int[][]
SZArraySig array2 = new SZArraySig(new SZArraySig(mod.CorLibTypes.Int32));

// Create an int[,]
ArraySig array3 = new ArraySig(mod.CorLibTypes.Int32, 2);

// Create an int[*] (one-dimensional array)
ArraySig array4 = new ArraySig(mod.CorLibTypes.Int32, 1);

// Create a Stream[]. Stream is a reference class so it must be enclosed in a ClassSig.
// If it were a value type, you would use ValueTypeSig instead.
TypeRef stream = new TypeRefUser(mod, "System.IO", "Stream", mod.CorLibTypes.AssemblyRef);
SZArraySig array5 = new SZArraySig(new ClassSig(stream));
```

Sometimes you must convert an `ITypeDefOrRef` (`TypeRef`, `TypeDef`, or
`TypeSpec`) to/from a `TypeSig`. There's extension methods you can use:

```csharp
// array5 is defined above
ITypeDefOrRef type1 = array5.ToTypeDefOrRef();
TypeSig type2 = type1.ToTypeSig();
```

Naming conventions of metadata table classes
--------------------------------------------

For most tables in the metadata, there's a corresponding dnlib class with the
exact same or a similar name. Eg. the metadata has a `TypeDef` table, and dnlib
has a `TypeDef` class. Some tables don't have a class because they're
referenced by other classes, and that information is part of some other class.
Eg. the `TypeDef` class contains all its properties and events, even though the
`TypeDef` table has no property or event column.

For each of these table classes, there's an abstract base class, and two sub
classes. These sub classes are named the same as the base class but ends in
either `MD` (for classes created from the metadata) or `User` (for classes
created by the user). Eg. `TypeDef` is the base class, and it has two sub
classes `TypeDefMD` which is auto-created from metadata, and `TypeRefUser`
which is created by the user when adding user types. Most of the XyzMD classes
are internal and can't be referenced directly by the user. They're created by
`ModuleDefMD` (which is the only public `MD` class). All XyzUser classes are
public.

Metadata table classes
----------------------

Here's a list of the most common metadata table classes

`AssemblyDef` is the assembly class.

`AssemblyRef` is an assembly reference.

`EventDef` is an event definition. Owned by a `TypeDef`.

`FieldDef` is a field definition. Owned by a `TypeDef`.

`GenericParam` is a generic parameter (owned by a `MethodDef` or a `TypeDef`)

`MemberRef` is what you create if you need a field reference or a method
reference.

`MethodDef` is a method definition. It usually has a `CilBody` with CIL
instructions. Owned by a `TypeDef`.

`MethodSpec` is a instantiated generic method.

`ModuleDef` is the base module class. When you read an existing module, a
`ModuleDefMD` is created.

`ModuleRef` is a module reference.

`PropertyDef` is a property definition. Owned by a `TypeDef`.

`TypeDef` is a type definition. It contains a lot of interesting stuff,
including methods, fields, properties, etc.

`TypeRef` is a type reference. Usually to a type in another assembly.

`TypeSpec` is a type specification, eg. an array, generic type, etc.

Method classes
--------------

The following are the method classes: `MethodDef`, `MemberRef` (method ref) and
`MethodSpec`. They all implement `IMethod`.

Field classes
-------------

The following are the field classes: `FieldDef` and `MemberRef` (field ref).
They both implement `IField`.

Comparing types, methods, fields, etc
-------------------------------------

dnlib has a `SigComparer` class that can compare any type with any other type.
Any method with any other method, etc. It also has several pre-created
`IEqualityComparer<T>` classes (eg. `TypeEqualityComparer`,
`FieldEqualityComparer`, etc) which you can use if you intend to eg. use a type
as a key in a `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`.

The `SigComparer` class can also compare types with `System.Type`, methods with
`System.Reflection.MethodBase`, etc.

It has many options you can set, see `SigComparerOptions`. The default options
is usually good enough, though.

```csharp
// Compare two types
TypeRef type1 = ...;
TypeDef type2 = ...;
if (new SigComparer().Equals(type1, type2))
	Console.WriteLine("They're equal");

// Use the type equality comparer
Dictionary<IType, int> dict = new Dictionary<IType, int>(TypeEqualityComparer.Instance);
TypeDef type1 = ...;
dict.Add(type1, 10);

// Compare a `TypeRef` with a `System.Type`
TypeRef type1 = ...;
if (new SigComparer().Equals(type1, typeof(int)))
	Console.WriteLine("They're equal");
```

It has many `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` overloads.

.NET Resources
--------------

There's three types of .NET resource, and they all derive from the common base
class `Resource`. `ModuleDef.Resources` is a list of all resources the module
owns.

`EmbeddedResource` is a resource that has data embedded in the owner module.
This is the most common type of resource and it's probably what you want.

`AssemblyLinkedResource` is a reference to a resource in another assembly.

`LinkedResource` is a reference to a resource on disk.

Win32 resources
---------------

`ModuleDef.Win32Resources` can be null or a `Win32Resources` instance. You can
add/remove any Win32 resource blob. dnlib doesn't try to parse these blobs.

Parsing method bodies
---------------------

This is usually only needed if you have decrypted a method body. If it's a
standard method body, you can use `MethodBodyReader.Create()`. If it's similar
to a standard method body, you can derive a class from `MethodBodyReaderBase`
and override the necessary methods.

Resolving references
--------------------

`TypeRef.Resolve()` and `MemberRef.Resolve()` both use
`module.Context.Resolver` to resolve the type, field or method. The custom
attribute parser code may also resolve type references.

If you call Resolve() or read custom attributes, you should initialize
module.Context to a `ModuleContext`. It should normally be shared between all
modules you open.

```csharp
AssemblyResolver asmResolver = new AssemblyResolver();
ModuleContext modCtx = new ModuleContext(asmResolver);

// All resolved assemblies will also get this same modCtx
asmResolver.DefaultModuleContext = modCtx;

// Enable the TypeDef cache for all assemblies that are loaded
// by the assembly resolver. Only enable it if all auto-loaded
// assemblies are read-only.
asmResolver.EnableTypeDefCache = true;
```

All assemblies that you yourself open should be added to the assembly resolver
cache.

```csharp
ModuleDefMD mod = ModuleDefMD.Load(...);
mod.Context = modCtx;	// Use the previously created (and shared) context
mod.Context.AssemblyResolver.AddToCache(mod);
```

Resolving types, methods, etc from metadata tokens
--------------------------------------------------

`ModuleDefMD` has several `ResolveXXX()` methods, eg. `ResolveTypeDef()`,
`ResolveMethod()`, etc.

Creating mscorlib type references
---------------------------------

Every module has a `CorLibTypes` property. It has references to a few of the
simplest types such as all integer types, floating point types, Object, String,
etc. If you need a type that's not there, you must create it yourself, eg.:

```csharp
TypeRef consoleRef = new TypeRefUser(mod, "System", "Console", mod.CorLibTypes.AssemblyRef);
```

Importing runtime types, methods, fields
----------------------------------------

To import a `System.Type`, `System.Reflection.MethodInfo`,
`System.Reflection.FieldInfo`, etc into a module, use the `Importer` class.

```csharp
Importer importer = new Importer(mod);
ITypeDefOrRef consoleRef = importer.Import(typeof(System.Console));
IMethod writeLine = importer.Import(typeof(System.Console).GetMethod("WriteLine"));
```

You can also use it to import types, methods etc from another `ModuleDef`.

All imported types, methods etc will be references to the original assembly.
I.e., it won't add the imported `TypeDef` to the target module. It will just
create a `TypeRef` to it.

Using decrypted methods
-----------------------

If `ModuleDefMD.MethodDecrypter` is initialized, `ModuleDefMD` will call it and
check whether the method has been decrypted. If it has, it calls
`IMethodDecrypter.GetMethodBody()` which you should implement. Return the new
`MethodBody`. `GetMethodBody()` should usually call `MethodBodyReader.Create()`
which does the actual parsing of the CIL code.

It's also possible to override `ModuleDefMD.ReadUserString()`. This method is
called by the CIL parser when it finds a `Ldstr` instruction. If
`ModuleDefMD.StringDecrypter` is not null, its `ReadUserString()` method is
called with the string token. Return the decrypted string or null if it should
be read from the `#US` heap.

Low level access to the metadata
--------------------------------

The low level classes are in the `dnlib.DotNet.MD` namespace.

Open an existing .NET module/assembly and you get a ModuleDefMD. It has several
properties, eg. `StringsStream` is the #Strings stream.

The `MetaData` property gives you full access to the metadata.

To get a list of all valid TypeDef rids (row IDs), use this code:

```csharp
using dnlib.DotNet.MD;

ModuleDefMD mod = ModuleDefMD.Load(...);
RidList typeDefRids = mod.MetaData.GetTypeDefRidList();
for (int i = 0; i < typeDefRids.Count; i++)
	Console.WriteLine("rid: {0}", typeDefRids[i]);
```

You don't need to create a `ModuleDefMD`, though. See `DotNetFile`.
